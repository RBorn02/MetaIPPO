Code for **Emergence of collective open-ended exploration from
Decentralized Meta-Reinforcement learning**

We train two decentralized agents together on an open ended tasks space to study the emergence of collective exploration behaviors. Our agents are able to generalize to novel objects and tasks, as well as an essentially open ended setting. For videos of the trained agents acting in the environment see https://sites.google.com/view/collective-open-ended-explore/
